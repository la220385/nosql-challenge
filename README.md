# UK Food Standards Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of food hygiene ratings across various establishments in the United Kingdom. The project is structured to assist the editorial team of the food magazine *Eat Safe, Love* in determining focus areas for future articles based on food safety standards.

## Project Background

This endeavor utilized the following tools and techniques:
- **MongoDB**: For database management and queries.
- **PyMongo**: To interact with MongoDB from Python.
- **Python**: For running data manipulation and analysis scripts.

The project was divided into three main parts:
1. **Database Setup**: Configuring MongoDB and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Database Updates**: Modifying and updating database records to meet project requirements.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing exploratory data analysis to answer specific research questions.

## What I've Completed

### Part 1: Database Setup
- **Importing Data**: Used `mongoimport` to load data into the database from a JSON file.
- **Python and MongoDB Setup**: Established connections to the MongoDB server, accessed databases, and performed initial data checks.

### Part 2: Update the Database
- **Adding New Data**: Inserted new data into the database for an unreviewed establishment.
- **Data Modification**: Updated specific fields and removed unnecessary records based on editorial needs.

### Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
- **Hygiene and Rating Analysis**: Investigated hygiene scores and overall ratings to identify trends and insights.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Analyzed data based on location to pinpoint areas with higher food safety ratings.

## Key Learnings

The project enhanced my understanding of:
- **Data Importing Techniques**: How to effectively use MongoDB import functions.
- **Advanced Querying**: Developing complex queries to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
- **Data Presentation**: Transforming raw data into actionable insights that can inform editorial decisions.

## Conclusion

This README provides a detailed overview of the setup, operations, and analysis involved in the UK Food Standards Analysis project. The documentation is designed to ensure reproducibility and to help future analysts understand the methodologies used, contributing to informed and reliable insights into food hygiene standards.
